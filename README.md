# Game Mechanics:

*Player Control*: The player controls a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. The cannon can move left and right using the arrow keys.

*Alien Waves*: Aliens descend from the top of the screen in waves. The aliens move horizontally and descend towards the player.

*Shooting*: The player can shoot by pressing the space bar. The goal is to shoot down the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.

*Alien Fire*: Aliens may also shoot at the player's cannon, and the player must avoid being hit by their fire.

*Difficulty Scaling*: As the game progresses, the alien waves should become faster and more challenging.

*Lives and Score*: The player starts with a certain number of lives, and they lose a life if an alien reaches the bottom of the screen. The player can earn points by shooting down aliens.

# Technical Stack Requirements:

*Programming Language*: You can use a variety of programming languages, but popular choices include Python with libraries like Pygame, JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas, or even game development engines like Unity or Godot.

*Graphics*: You'll need to create or source graphics for the game elements, including the laser cannon, aliens, bullets, and background. Graphics can be created using tools like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or pixel art software.

*Game Physics*: Implement game physics to handle movement, collisions, and the behavior of game objects. Libraries like Pygame, Unity, or physics engines like Box2D can help with this.

*Input Handling*: Capture user input for controlling the laser cannon. In Python, you can use the Pygame library's event handling, and in JavaScript, you can capture keyboard events.

*Game Loop*: Implement a game loop to continuously update the game state, handle input, and redraw the game screen. The loop should run at a consistent frame rate.

*Sound and Music*: Add audio effects and background music for a more immersive experience. Use libraries or tools like FMOD, Wwise, or HTML5 audio APIs.

*Scoring and Lives*: Implement a scoring system and track the number of lives the player has. Update and display this information on the game screen.

*AI for Aliens*: Create AI logic for the alien movement and shooting behavior. You can use basic algorithms to control their patterns and firing rate.

*Difficulty Progression*: Adjust the game's difficulty by increasing the speed of alien movement and firing rate as the player progresses.

*Game Over State*: Implement a game over condition when the player loses all their lives. Display a game over screen with the option to restart.

*Testing and Debugging*: Thoroughly test the game to identify and fix any bugs or issues. Testing tools and techniques are essential.

*Deployment*: If you want to share your game with others, consider deployment options, such as creating standalone executables or publishing the game on game distribution platforms.
